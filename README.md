Tic-tac-toe Readme For Git Hub
Tic-Tac-Toe

A modern implementation of the classic 3×3 game in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with responsive design, reset functionality, and win detection.




✨ Features

Player vs Player (local): Alternate turns between O and X

Win Detection: Highlights when three in a row are achieved

Dynamic UI: Uses images (o.png and x.png) for player marks

Game Controls: Reset and New Game buttons included

Responsive & Simple: Easy to extend and style with CSS

🧠 How It Works

The game board is represented by 9 buttons with the class .box.

Players take turns placing O and X (o.png, x.png).

Each move disables the selected box to prevent overwriting.

The script checks winning combinations from winPatterns.

If a winner is found, a message displays and the board disables.

Players can reset or start a new game via the buttons.
